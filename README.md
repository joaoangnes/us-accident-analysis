# Traffic Accident Analysis in the United States

This project aims to analyze traffic accidents that occurred in the United States. The goal is to identify patterns in accidents based on various factors, such as weather conditions, road types, and regions.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Using `pandas` to clean the data, remove duplicates, and fill in missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using `seaborn` to find correlations and patterns between accidents and the available variables.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Creating interactive visualizations using `plotly`, such as interactive maps to display where the most severe accidents occur.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Implementing time-based heatmaps to identify the time of day or days of the week when accidents are most frequent.

## Group Goal
The main goal of this project is to understand the key factors that affect the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents. Our analysis will incorporate rich interactive graphs to help explore accident patterns over time and space.

## Dataset
